round chamber with wake
flat chamber with wake

The results were obtained with an installation on lxplus779.cern.ch (CC7), on 2022-09-03

The run times are approximately:
<1 sec for round chamber
5  sec for flat chamber
42 sec for flat chamber non-linear
10 sec for round chamber with wake
42 sec for flat chamber with wake

This folder also contains a few older examples, for the LHC injection protection collimator (TDI) and for SLSII.
